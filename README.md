# static-site-ci-cd
This is a basic static Website project that I am using to show my ability to implement CI/CD pipeline. An HTML file is availble in the root of my repo as well as the CSS. I have included and empty requirements file due to an error I got when trying to deploy. The YAML file can be found inside the workflows folder. an image used for the site can be located in the img folder.
